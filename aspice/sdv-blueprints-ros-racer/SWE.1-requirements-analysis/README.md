## Overview

The **ROS Racer Blueprint** is an Eclipse Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) demonstration that showcases how cloud-native orchestration and over-the-air (OTA) software delivery can be applied to autonomous racing vehicles. This blueprint brings together several Eclipse SDV technologies to create a realistic, multi-agent autonomous racing simulation that demonstrates the future of vehicle software management.

At its core, this project uses the [F1TENTH](https://f1tenth.org/) autonomous racing platform combined with [Eclipse Muto](https://github.com/eclipse-muto/muto) - an adaptive framework for dynamically composable, model-driven software stacks in ROS 2 environments. The blueprint demonstrates how multiple autonomous racecars can be orchestrated, updated, and managed in real-time through both direct ROS topic communication and cloud-based orchestration via Eclipse Symphony.

### Key Capabilities

- **Multi-Agent Simulation**: Up to 20 autonomous racecars running independently with the F1TENTH gym environment
- **OTA Software Updates**: Zero-downtime deployment of new driving algorithms to running vehicles
- **Automatic Rollback**: Self-healing fleet that automatically reverts failed deployments
- **Fleet Heterogeneity**: Deploy different algorithms to individual vehicles based on role or conditions
- **Dual Orchestration Modes**: 
  - Direct ROS topic-based deployment (Muto native)
  - Cloud-native orchestration via Eclipse Symphony
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time RViz visualization accessible through web browser (noVNC)

## Architecture

The ROS Racer Blueprint implements a sophisticated multi-layer architecture that separates simulation, edge compute, orchestration, and artifact management concerns.

### High-Level Architecture Diagram

### Component Details

#### 1. **Simulation Layer**

The simulation layer is built on the F1TENTH Gym environment with ROS 2 integration:

- **F1TENTH Gym Simulator (`sim` container)**
  - Provides physics-based simulation of 1/10th scale autonomous racecars
  - Battle-tested multi-agent scenarios with up to 20 vehicles
  - Publishes sensor data (`/racecar*/scan`, `/racecar*/odom`) where * is the racecar number
  - Subscribes to control commands (`/racecar*/drive`)
  - Runs RViz for 3D visualization
  - Uses CycloneDDS for ROS 2 middleware (low-latency, efficient)

- **noVNC Visualization**
  - Browser-accessible VNC server (no client installation required)
  - Provides real-time view of RViz visualization
  - Accessible at `http://localhost:8080/vnc.html`
  - Displays all three vehicles on the Spielberg race track

#### 2. **Edge Layer - Eclipse Muto Stack**

Each autonomous vehicle (racecar1, racecar2, racecar3) runs a complete Eclipse Muto stack in its own container. This represents the edge compute environment that would exist on a real vehicle.

##### Eclipse Muto Components

**Muto Agent**
- Handles cloud connectivity and external orchestration
- **MQTT Gateway**: Bidirectional bridge to cloud MQTT brokers (Eclipse Ditto, Symphony)
- **Commands Plugin**: Enables remote execution of ROS commands (topic list, node info, parameter get, etc.)
- **Symphony Provider**: Integration point for Eclipse Symphony orchestration
- Listens on vehicle-specific topics (e.g., `/racecar1_muto/stack`)

**Muto Core**
- **Digital Twin**: Maintains a synchronized representation of vehicle state
- Publishes vehicle attributes, status, and capabilities
- Integration with Eclipse Ditto for cloud-side digital twin management

**Muto Composer**
- The heart of dynamic software composition and OTA updates
- **Main Composer**: Orchestrates the full stack lifecycle
  - Receives stack definitions via ROS topics or MQTT
  - Coordinates provision → build → launch sequence
  - Manages workspace states and transitions
  - Implements automatic rollback on failure
  
- **Provision Plugin**: 
  - Downloads stack packages from artifact server (HTTP)
  - Validates checksums (SHA256)
  - Extracts archives to workspace directories
  - Manages `~/.muto/workspaces/{stack_name}/` structure

- **Compose Plugin**:
  - Builds ROS 2 workspaces using `colcon build`
  - Resolves dependencies via `rosdep`
  - Creates isolated build environments per stack

- **Launch Plugin**:
  - Starts/stops ROS nodes based on stack launch files
  - Monitors node health and lifecycle
  - Implements graceful shutdown and cleanup
  - Detects failures and triggers rollback

**Dynamic Workspaces**
- Each deployed stack creates a workspace under `~/.muto/workspaces/`
- Workspaces are self-contained ROS 2 packages with:
  - Source code (extracted from .tar.gz)
  - Build artifacts (colcon build output)
  - Launch scripts (e.g., `run.sh`)
  - Configuration files
- Multiple workspaces can coexist; Composer manages which is active

#### 3. **Service Layer**

**Artifact Server**
- Simple Python HTTP server serving on port 9090
- Hosts stack packages as `.tar.gz` archives:
  - `gap_follower_conservative.tar.gz`
  - `gap_follower_balanced.tar.gz`
  - `gap_follower_aggressive.tar.gz`
  - `gap_follower_broken.tar.gz` (intentionally broken for rollback demo)
- Each package contains ROS 2 workspace with driving algorithm implementation
- Checksums in stack definitions ensure integrity

#### 4. **Cloud/Orchestration Layer (Optional)**

**Eclipse Symphony**
- Cloud-native orchestration platform for edge deployments
- **Symphony API**: REST API for managing solutions, instances, targets
- **Symphony Portal**: Web dashboard for fleet visualization
- **MQTT Bridge**: Mosquitto broker connects Symphony to Muto agents
- **Abstraction Model**:
  - **Solutions**: Versioned software packages (wraps Muto stacks)
  - **Targets**: Represents edge devices (vehicles)
  - **Instances**: Links solutions to targets, triggering deployment

## Eclipse Muto Integration

[Eclipse Muto](https://github.com/eclipse-muto/muto) is the cornerstone of this blueprint, providing the intelligent edge runtime that enables dynamic, cloud-native software management for ROS 2 systems.

### What is Eclipse Muto?

Eclipse Muto is an **adaptive framework and runtime platform** for building dynamically composable, model-driven software stacks in ROS-based robotic systems. It brings cloud-native DevOps practices to the edge, enabling:

- **Dynamic Composition**: Load, build, and launch ROS packages at runtime without redeployment
- **OTA Updates**: Zero-downtime software updates via stack definitions
- **Automatic Rollback**: Self-healing behavior when deployments fail
- **Digital Twin Integration**: Synchronized cloud-side representation of edge devices
- **Multi-Protocol Connectivity**: Support for MQTT, HTTP, and ROS 2 DDS
- **Model-Driven**: Stack definitions as declarative JSON/YAML

### Muto in the ROS Racer Blueprint

In this blueprint, Muto transforms traditional static ROS deployments into a dynamic, cloud-managed system:

#### 1. **Stack-Based Deployment Model**

Instead of baking algorithms into container images, Muto uses **stack definitions** - lightweight JSON descriptors:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "name": "gap_follower_balanced",
    "version": "1.1.0",
    "content_type": "stack/archive"
  },
  "launch": {
    "url": "http://artifact-server:9090/gap_follower_balanced.tar.gz",
    "properties": {
      "algorithm": "sha256",
      "checksum": "a1b2c3d4...",
      "launch_file": "run.sh",
      "flatten": true
    }
  }
}
```

This definition tells Muto:
- What to download (`url`)
- How to verify it (`checksum`)
- How to launch it (`launch_file`)
- Metadata for versioning and tracking

#### 2. **OTA Deployment Flow**

When a stack is deployed, Muto executes this sequence:

```
1. Stack Definition Received (ROS topic or MQTT)
   └─> Composer validates and queues

2. Provisioning Phase
   └─> Provision Plugin downloads .tar.gz from artifact server
   └─> Validates SHA256 checksum
   └─> Extracts to ~/.muto/workspaces/{stack_name}/

3. Build Phase
   └─> Compose Plugin runs 'colcon build'
   └─> Resolves dependencies
   └─> Creates install/ directory with ROS 2 artifacts

4. Launch Phase
   └─> Launch Plugin stops previous stack (graceful shutdown)
   └─> Sources new workspace setup.bash
   └─> Executes launch_file (e.g., run.sh)
   └─> Monitors node health

5. Validation
   └─> If nodes crash or fail to start within timeout:
       └─> Automatic rollback to previous working stack
   └─> If successful:
       └─> New stack becomes active
       └─> Digital twin updated with new state
```

#### 3. **Zero-Downtime Updates**

Muto achieves zero-downtime by:
- Building new workspaces alongside running ones (no interruption)
- Only switching to the new stack after successful build
- Gracefully terminating old nodes before starting new ones
- Maintaining state continuity through ROS 2 parameter persistence

#### 4. **Automatic Rollback**

The `gap_follower_broken` stack demonstrates Muto's self-healing by intentionally deploying a broken algorithm:

#### 5. **Fleet Management**

Muto's namespace-based architecture enables fleet-wide or targeted deployments:

Each vehicle independently:
 - Receives stack on its /{vehicle_name}_muto/stack topic
 - Executes full deployment pipeline
 - Manages its own workspace state
 - Reports status via digital twin

#### 6. **Digital Twin Synchronization**

Muto Core maintains a digital twin for each vehicle:

- **Attributes**: Vehicle ID, capabilities, hardware specs
- **State**: Current stack, version, deployed workspaces
- **Telemetry**: CPU, memory, network status
- **Events**: Deployment history, rollback events, errors

This twin synchronizes with Eclipse Ditto (cloud-side digital twin platform), enabling:
- Fleet-wide visibility into deployment status
- Historical audit trail
- Conditional deployments based on vehicle state
- Integration with Symphony for orchestration

#### 7. **Multi-Protocol Gateway**

Muto's MQTT Gateway bridges multiple communication domains:

```
Cloud (MQTT) ←→ Muto Agent ←→ ROS 2 (DDS)
                    ↕
              Digital Twin (Ditto)
                    ↕
           Symphony (Orchestration)
```

This enables:
- Remote command execution via MQTT
- Stack deployment from cloud or local ROS topics
- Telemetry streaming to cloud
- Symphony-based orchestration

## Key Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Initial Deployment
Deploy a conservative driving algorithm to all three vehicles for initial testing.

### Scenario 2: Progressive OTA Updates
Incrementally increase performance: conservative → balanced → aggressive, demonstrating seamless transitions.

### Scenario 3: Automatic Rollback
Deploy a broken algorithm and watch Muto automatically recover to the previous version.

### Scenario 4: Heterogeneous Fleet
Assign different algorithms to vehicles based on their role (lead car = conservative, middle = aggressive, rear = balanced).

### Scenario 5: Symphony Orchestration
Use Eclipse Symphony's REST API to manage deployments at scale, demonstrating cloud-native fleet management.

## Getting Started

For detailed instructions, see [Quickstart](docs/quickstart.md) and [demo/README.md](demo/README.md).

### Quick Start: Scaling to 20 Racecars

The system supports scaling from 3 up to 20 racecars with configurable ROS middleware.

#### Configuration Options

| Variable | Default | Options | Description |
|----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `NUM_AGENTS` | 3 | 1-20 | Number of racecars to spawn |
| `DEPLOY_STAGGER` | 0.5 | 0.0-2.0 | Delay between vehicle deployments (seconds) |

#### Basic Usage

```bash
# Default: 3 cars
python3 scripts/generate-compose.py > docker-compose.yml
docker compose up --build

# Scale to 10 cars
NUM_AGENTS=10 python3 scripts/generate-compose.py > docker-compose.yml
docker compose up --build

# Scale to 20 cars
NUM_AGENTS=20 python3 scripts/generate-compose.py > docker-compose.yml
docker compose up --build
```

#### Deploy with Varied Driving Styles

Generate per-vehicle stacks with cycling driving styles (aggressive → balanced → conservative):

```bash
# Generate stack files for all vehicles
NUM_AGENTS=20 python3 scripts/generate-gap-follower-stacks.py

# Deploy to all vehicles with staggered timing
NUM_AGENTS=20 python3 demo/scripts/deploy-stack-fleet.py
```

#### Resource Requirements (20 agents)

| Component | CPU | Memory |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| sim | 8.0 | 5GB |
| edge (×20) | 0.5 each | 512MB each |
| **Total** | ~18 cores | ~15GB |

Note: Sim resources scale automatically (2 + 0.3 per agent CPUs, 2GB + 150MB per agent).
